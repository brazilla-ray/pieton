# pi&eacute;ton  

[Pi&eacute;ton](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/french-english/pi%C3%A9ton) is a CSS color system that's bright and accessible.

## Usage  

In general, light colors over dark, and dark over light will yield the most accessible combinations.  
Each color has a `-fg` and a `-bg` modifier to use as a foreground or background color, respectively.  

## Examples  

### Yellow text on a black background.
```html
<section class="pieton-yellow-fg pieton-near-black-bg">
  walking is cool, don't let anyone tell you different.
</section>
```

### Blue text; no background specified.
```html
<a href="#" class="pieton-blue-fg">
  link
</a>
```
